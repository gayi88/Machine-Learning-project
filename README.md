# Machine-Learning-project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset. 

# How it works
- Users should select a model (SVM or Random forest using Radio button)
- Users can write digits in provided canvas and click predict button.
- The model recognises the digit.
- For the next prediction, first delete written digit by pressing the delete button below the canvas then write another digit.
  
# Wake up the app, it will take some time.
